Alan Kay famously critique World Wide Web (WWW) where HTML is originated. He publicly dislike HTML as followed

> Things like [HTML] happens when we let physicists play with computer.

He stated that HTML is a bad markup language because people who build HTML thinks their way of representing web page is the only way. He mentioned a (older and) better alternative to HTML is to define protocol based on ordered region on a tape --- back when tapes were still popular means of storage in 1950's. This protocol is more "dynamic" or "adaptive" in that the first regions that is read in to the machine define boundary of the rest of the region. This protocol is used in modern RAM to define regions -- such as swap files, files descriptors etc -- with an exception that the value of the first is decided by designers and the rest of the regions are kept.

This article is an opinion piece on [Comparison to other package managers](https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el#comparison-to-other-package-managers).

Emacs package manager are split into 2 categories: package.el wrapper or not package.el wrapper.

One idea that `straight.el` emphasizes a lot is that `straight.el` manages commits rather than managing a whole a package. Some PM only accept latest commit. Other only accepts repo on github etc. I call this design decision a "smallest unit of design implementation."

Other unique takes on managing Emacs packages are Borg (assimilates packages as Git submodules into .emacs.d).

That's it.
peace.

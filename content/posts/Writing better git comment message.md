Rule of thumb, from [here](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/74764/how-often-should-i-do-you-make-commits).

> Whenever I have something that works (meaning, doesn't break anything for anyone else) I'll do a check-in. I write most of my stuff test first, so that means every time I have a new test that passes, I check-in.
>
> In practice that means a few times per hour. At least a couple of times every hour, with 5 being quite a bit.

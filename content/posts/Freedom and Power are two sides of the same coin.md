According to dictionary, freedom is defined as

> The power or right to act, speak, or think as one wants without hindrance or restraint.

Power is defined as

> The capacity or ability to direct or influence the behavior of others or the course of events.

That's is power is defined by abilities to restrict others' freedom. Therefore, by definitions, an individual with more power has more freedom than others. Freedom cannot be defined without existence of power.

Lets imagine for a second that no one can have power over the others. In this case, definition of freedom can be defined by itself and one's ability to be free, for example, a deaf person doesn't have freedom to hear and a mute doesn't have freedom to speak, etc.

Lets a society be a function of its members as shown below in equation <3781832087>

<a id="orgc02f180"></a>

\\[
society = function(member\\\_of\\\_society)
\\]

Also assuming that optimizing quality of a society at any point in time is an optimization problem. This implies any properties (features) of a society can be quantified numerically. In this equation, freedom and power is a constraint where <5962778360>.

<a id="org75993fb"></a>

\\[
freedom + power = 1
\\]

That's it. at any given point in time, a society can reach its maximal freedom by diminishing power to 0. Note, in this context, quality of life is directly dependent on quality of society. And optimal quality of society at any point in time may differ. Lastly, I speculate that happiness directly depends on quality of life only upto a certain threshold.

Since, a society is a function of its population, removing oneself from a society to living alone may result in higher or lower quality of life.

That's it.
Peace.

<p>I think of note taking as a type of data storage with a property that satisfy my note taking philosophy. I wrote about philosophy of note taking in my blog titled &ldquo;Philosophy and Meta Physics of &lsquo;Notes Taking&rsquo;&quot;.</p>
<p>My pipeline has 3 components: note lake, note warehouse, and note compression. I will not go into implementation of each components because its every changing, but the framework always stands.</p>
<p>First, characteristics of note lake is as followed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>note is easily imported from external source without requirement on structure of data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Secondly, Characteristics of note warehouse is as followed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>all notes are structured based on relevancy.</li>
<li>all notes are queryable via a question-oriented search.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I derive characteristics of note warehouse from my note taking philosophy, see my blog titled &ldquo;Philosophy and Meta Physics of &lsquo;Notes Taking&rsquo;,&rdquo; where the first point is solved by one of my note types called &ldquo;a note as a collection of question.&rdquo; Furthermore, on the second point, it is important to note that there is no requirement that all quried data must share any degree of relevancy, instead, the only constraint is that all related note that satisfied question-oriented query must be returned.</p>
<p>Lastly, characteristics of note compression are as followed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>content of note is expressive via one or more forms of <code>representation of your understanding</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wrote about <code>representation of understanding</code> in my blog titled &ldquo;Access Your Level of Understanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t covered how to use this note taking pipeline. I will cover it in other blog.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.
Peace.</p>

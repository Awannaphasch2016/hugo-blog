<p>Figure &lt;Figure_21.3&gt; and figure &lt;Figure_21.4&gt; uses the same set of locks which is provided in Shared/Exclusive locks including read_lock, write_lock and unlock. However, figure &lt;Figure_21.4&gt; is considered 2PL while figure &lt;Figure_21.3&gt; is not. Note that 2PL is Shared/Exclusive locks with additional protocol called <code>two phase locking protocol</code>. The different between 2PL and shared/exclusive lock is that 2PL guarantee serialization while the other doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The book also mentioned that while 2PL protocol guarantee sheduling serializability. It doesn&rsquo;t permit all possible serializable schedules.</p>
<p>Serialization is achieved via by converting figure &lt;Figure_21.3&gt; to figure &lt;Figure_21.4&gt; because figure &lt;Figure_21.4&gt; reorders write_lock(X) and write_lock(Y) to be right before unlock(Y) and unlock(X), respectively.</p>
<p>Naturally, two questions arises.</p>
<p>Considering \(T_1\), the first question is &ldquo;why does order of write_lock(X) and unlock(Y) matter?&rdquo; To answer this question, one have to think in term of constraint that would results in serialization.  In \(T_{1}\), value of Y is read first. This means Y should be locked until <code>X = X+Y</code> is written. This condition is satisfied by placing write_lock(X) above unlock(Y). This can be read as &ldquo;write X before unlock Y.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To satisfy the above constraints, in \(T_1\), write_lock have to be placed on X until <code>X = X +Y</code> is executed. This guarantees that X will not be changed until <code>X = X+Y</code> is executed. At the same time, \(T_{1}\) doesn&rsquo;t need to be any constraint on Y except that \(T_1\) needs to be informed of any changes made in Y before <code>X = X+Y</code> will be computed.</p>
<p>Secondly, considering \(T_1\), &ldquo;can write_lock(X) be anywhere else above unlock(Y)?&rdquo; The answer is yes, but the reason that it is placed right above unlock is for efficiency by reducing queue waiting time. Recall that when write_lock is called, neither read nor write can be called on the same data. <code>To guarantee this efficiency, distant between write_lock(X) and write_item(X) needs to be minimized</code>.</p>

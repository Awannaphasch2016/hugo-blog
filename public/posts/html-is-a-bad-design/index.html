<p>He stated that HTML is a bad markup language because people who build HTML thinks their way of representing web page is the only way. He mentioned a (older and) better alternative to HTML is to define protocol based on ordered region on a tape &mdash; back when tapes were still popular means of storage in 1950&rsquo;s. This protocol is more &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo; or &ldquo;adaptive&rdquo; in that the first regions that is read in to the machine define boundary of the rest of the region. This protocol is used in modern RAM to define regions &ndash; such as swap files, files descriptors etc &ndash; with an exception that the value of the first is decided by designers and the rest of the regions are kept.</p>

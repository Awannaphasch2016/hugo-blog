<p>Money is the most flexible medium of exchange. For more detail please refer to my blog named &ldquo;Money Is A Type of Token.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Motivation drive efforts. Effort is a seed of creation and innovation. It just happens that money provides universal motivation due to its utility which is measured by speed of conversion from itself to other assets. Money has fastest conversion rates. It is important to remember that Utility of token or money exists at all as a result of shared believe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.
Peace.</p>

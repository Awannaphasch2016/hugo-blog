<p>All org roam does is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>create name of a note file using org roam file name convention.</li>
<li>add <code>:ROAM_REFS:</code> as a note property whose value is an org-ref citation.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>orb-insert-link</code> (<code>orb</code> is an abbreviation for <code>org-roam-bibtex</code>) creates new node (from citation entry shown in citation completion mechanism like helm-bibtex) if the node of that entry hasn&rsquo;t yet existed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>

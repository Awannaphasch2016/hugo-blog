      First of all, I am no expert in LaTeX. I am just a dude who has (a lot) of trouble installing LaTeX and was trying to solve it.
From this experience, I learn important lesson is always start digging from the official documentation of the target packages/libraries. This is because there are many two types of solution in general: general solution and environment specific solution.
In this case, its clearly a environment specific problem which required environemnt speicific solution.

      &ldquo;Adding jump state to command.&rdquo; implies that position ((point)) that the added command is evaluated is added to jump state. In the other word, you can get back to (point) that you executed the command by using (better-jumper-jump-forward).
I was trying to add &ldquo;jump state&rdquo; to (+spell/previous-error) and +spell/next-error.
Note that +spell prefix means this command is provided by a Doom&rsquo;s module. From a quick glance into the code, it is clear that &mdash; just like other Doom&rsquo;s module &mdash; it implements branching condition to allow fallback behavior based on context such as current mode or available packages.

      I always get lost in the detail when learning or working on math, and I find that new math concept introduced only a few important concepts. The rest are filling in details by connecting new and old concepts in the right order using math notation.
Think of new math concepts as tools that are reusable for tasks in which tools are specialized for.
In this series of &ldquo;Explaining X&rdquo; where X is any mathematical concept, I will try to avoid mathematical details and will try my best to capture the newly introduced concept.

      I was trying to implement my own scratch buffer.I learned alot about Emacs&rsquo;s way of programming. I gained a new mental debugging tool.
The main function I started to modify is doom/open-scratch-buffer. The functions deals with opening scratch buffer when current-buffer is inside and outside of a projectile&rsquo;s project.
doom/open-scratch-buffer does the following
 check if scratch will open in the same buffer or as pop up buffer Then, it passes arguments to (doom-scratch-buffer &amp;optional DONT-RESTORE-P MODE DIRECTORY PROJECT-NAME).

      Note taking is a skill that everyone seems to think that they have &ldquo;solved&rdquo; it. Whatever that means. They are not interested in investing their time to improve their note taking skill.
No interest. No skill. No framework.
Regardless of my critique, I think they draw conclusion fairly. Why? around 6 out of 10 people are knowledge workerÂ 1. A subset of those need to use note at all. A subset of those who use notes need to create reusable notes.

      &ldquo;Internetworking Architecture&rdquo; (Leiner et al. 2009) was a fundamental design that enable machines and computers to communicate via internet regardless of underlying communication protocol.
TCP/IP were implemented in UNIX operating system triggers a widespread adoption of internet (Leiner et al. 2009). Dispersion of protocols began in research community. Recall that predecessor of internet project (it was named &ldquo;internetworking&rdquo; at the time) was funded with the goal to increase speed and efficiency of research collaborations.

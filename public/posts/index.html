      First of all, I am no expert in LaTeX. I am just a dude who has (a lot) of trouble installing LaTeX and was trying to solve it.
From this experience, I learn important lesson is always start digging from the official documentation of the target packages/libraries. This is because there are many two types of solution in general: general solution and environment specific solution.
In this case, its clearly a environment specific problem which required environemnt speicific solution.

      Note taking is a skill that everyone seems to think that they have &ldquo;solved&rdquo; it. Whatever that means. They are not interested in investing their time to improve their note taking skill.
No interest. No skill. No framework.
Regardless of my critique, I think they draw conclusion fairly. Why? around 6 out of 10 people are knowledge worker 1. A subset of those need to use note at all. A subset of those who use notes need to create reusable notes.

      In AWS IAM, a policy is the smallest entity of permission. There are types of policies: resources-based policy, identity-based policy, and session-based policy.
  Figure 1: aws policies
  Policies can be attached to the following &ldquo;identity&rdquo;: user (1 account can have more than 1 users), role, and group (a group has many user) 1. user, role, and group are called identity.

      Straight&rsquo;s recipe is similar but not identify to one used by MELPA. 1
A recipe describes which local repository to link the files from and how to clone that repository, if repo is not found locally. With this definition of recipe, one can think of recipe as a build step (recipe) of a package.
Ultimately, a package is defined is a collection of files required for package&rsquo;s build. striaght.el views a package in this manner.

      This article is based on staright.el README which at the moment doesn&rsquo;t have written document on how transaction works. So This is a work in progress until I either read straight.el codebase or summarize its documentation.
Conceptually, stright.el clones Git repo and them symlinking files into Emacs&rsquo;s load path. A packages in straight.el is defined as recipe as a files which was symlinked together. I have an article on recipe.

      When I first get into Emacs, I was a vim user before, so I picked up Doom Emacs without experience with vanilla Emacs. Transition has been smooth so far, but because I never has experience with Vanilla Emacs before when I encounter a bug in Doom Emacs. I always have to first figure out if it is Doom Emacs problem or Emacs problems. Because of this, I put out a new blog series to help me build a stronger foundation of Vanilla Emacs.

      This article is an opinion piece on Comparison to other package managers.
Emacs package manager are split into 2 categories: package.el wrapper or not package.el wrapper.
One idea that straight.el emphasizes a lot is that straight.el manages commits rather than managing a whole a package. Some PM only accept latest commit. Other only accepts repo on github etc. I call this design decision a &ldquo;smallest unit of design implementation.&rdquo;
Other unique takes on managing Emacs packages are Borg (assimilates packages as Git submodules into .

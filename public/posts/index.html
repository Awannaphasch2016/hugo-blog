      First of all, I am no expert in LaTeX. I am just a dude who has (a lot) of trouble installing LaTeX and was trying to solve it.
From this experience, I learn important lesson is always start digging from the official documentation of the target packages/libraries. This is because there are many two types of solution in general: general solution and environment specific solution.
In this case, its clearly a environment specific problem which required environemnt speicific solution.

Blog. Piece. Article. Whatever you called it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I will redefine it here. For the rest of the blog, I will use the word blog.

      Straight&rsquo;s recipe is similar but not identify to one used by MELPA.Â 1
A recipe describes which local repository to link the files from and how to clone that repository, if repo is not found locally. With this definition of recipe, one can think of recipe as a build step (recipe) of a package.
Ultimately, a package is defined is a collection of files required for package&rsquo;s build. striaght.el views a package in this manner.

      This article is based on staright.el README which at the moment doesn&rsquo;t have written document on how transaction works. So This is a work in progress until I either read straight.el codebase or summarize its documentation.
Conceptually, stright.el clones Git repo and them symlinking files into Emacs&rsquo;s load path. A packages in straight.el is defined as recipe as a files which was symlinked together. I have an article on recipe.

      When I first get into Emacs, I was a vim user before, so I picked up Doom Emacs without experience with vanilla Emacs. Transition has been smooth so far, but because I never has experience with Vanilla Emacs before when I encounter a bug in Doom Emacs. I always have to first figure out if it is Doom Emacs problem or Emacs problems. Because of this, I put out a new blog series to help me build a stronger foundation of Vanilla Emacs.

      This article is an opinion piece on Comparison to other package managers.
Emacs package manager are split into 2 categories: package.el wrapper or not package.el wrapper.
One idea that straight.el emphasizes a lot is that straight.el manages commits rather than managing a whole a package. Some PM only accept latest commit. Other only accepts repo on github etc. I call this design decision a &ldquo;smallest unit of design implementation.&rdquo;
Other unique takes on managing Emacs packages are Borg (assimilates packages as Git submodules into .

      Personally, I think snippets is under untilize. Same as notes. The fact is people just don&rsquo;t do neither snippets or notes.
I defined code snippet as followed
 A collection of either small/large code which may store in single/multiple files that you will revisit against in the future.
 Focusing on manging code snippets in emacs, few packages come to mind including: yassnipet, auto-yasnippet, yankpad, and code library.
In my workflow, to share code snippet with others, gists is needed.

      Org-ref manage citation entry, referenced citation, PDF, and note just fine. But the problem arise when trying to link notes created org-ref as a node in org roam. This is the problem that orb solve to allow PDF notes to be inserted as a org roam node. To summarize, the problem that orb solve to integrate org-ref functionalities into org-roam ecosystem.
All org roam does is the following:
 create name of a note file using org roam file name convention.

      Dev logs is new blog series which dive deep into implementation level. The goal is to understand how things works. I figure this should be an interesting series because I always wanted to know how these program works underneath. Instead of explaining the whole code base, I will only focus on the &ldquo;magical&rdquo; part that sparked my interest the most.
Todays I present to you aya.
I started of the series with aya because, I think, it is a small package with the right portion of magic.

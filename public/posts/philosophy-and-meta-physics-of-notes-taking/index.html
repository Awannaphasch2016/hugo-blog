Whatever that means. They are not interested in investing their time to improve their note taking skill.</p>
<p>No interest. No skill. No framework.</p>
<p>Regardless of my critique, I think they draw conclusion fairly. Why? around 6 out of 10 people are knowledge worker <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. A subset of those need to use note at all. A subset of those who use notes need to create reusable notes. A subset of those who create reusable note needs the notes to be reusable forever.</p>
<p>Even professors, the highest regard of knowledge workers, most of them don&rsquo;t have reusable notes beyond paper they publish. I would argue that published paper is NOT a good note. I explain this point in my blog titled &ldquo;Writing a &lsquo;Blog&rsquo;.&rdquo; In short, I categorized published paper as &ldquo;blog that you write for others to read.&rdquo; Good reusable notes should be &ldquo;blog that you write for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To put it simply,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People Don&rsquo;t Know How To Create Or Use Notes At The Highest Efficiency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was the same as them, but I came to an inevitable conclusion that my memory sucks. I tried to train for it. No help. It is the first time I reached my genetic limit.</p>
<p>Memory is a bitch. Sometimes, it make you believe that you/someone did something but you/someone didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Imagine this scenario. you read the whole book on something. Did all the exercise. Make sure that you &ldquo;understand&rdquo; it. For an interval of time after you learned it, You remember it. You can explain it. You can use it. But then, you didn&rsquo;t have to use this knowledge for 3 years. You still believed that you understand it. You was an expert on it once. But reality hits&hellip; Now you don&rsquo;t remember jack shit.</p>
<p>This is the point where people start telling me &ldquo;it is because you didn&rsquo;t &lsquo;understand&rsquo; it.&rdquo; My usual respond is &ldquo;how do you evaluate that you understand something?&rdquo; Every answer that I ever get I did and I passed the evaluation process they suggested. They suggestions don&rsquo;t work for me, so like always I created my own. On this topic, I wrote an article titled &ldquo;Assess Your Level of Understanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you at some point think, you can solve memory issue with &ldquo;space repetition.&rdquo; No, it is not. It helps you understand facts, but doesn&rsquo;t help you evaluate your level of understanding.</p>
<p>After acknowledging my genetic limitation, I start writing notes with a hope that I will just read my notes when I don&rsquo;t remember something. Another problem arises. Sometimes, I can&rsquo;t find it. Sometimes, it takes too long to find. It&rsquo;s just not efficient. I realized that using note to help with memory retrieval is an engineering problem rather than a fundamental flaw in the approach.</p>
<p>After 3 years of experimentation, I think I solve it.</p>
<p>When I talk about note taking to people, I usually asked &ldquo;How do you take note?,&rdquo; &ldquo;When do you use your notes?&rdquo; etc. What I was trying to get at is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the property of your notes?
and
what is the constraint in which you interact with your notes?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two questions is a sub question that ask &ldquo;What problem do you expect your note to solve?&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know about others.</p>
<p>Before answering the two questions let me define notes as followed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note is a collection of text and picture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s is my brain. I built my own vocabulary for my own use.</p>
<p>My answer to the following question is as followed.
I want my notes to have the following properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>notes should be quickly extracted and stored from anywhere.</li>
<li>notes should be able to grow organically.</li>
<li>notes should be easily retrievable at the speed of thought.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first properties are idea of &ldquo;second brain.&rdquo; The second property is an idea of &ldquo;Zettlekasten.&rdquo; The third property is there to guarantee maximum efficiency.</p>
<p>I have three types of notes.</p>
<ol>
<li>a note as a question.</li>
<li>a note as an answer.</li>
<li>a note as a collection of question.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two type falls into &ldquo;a note as a seed&rdquo; followed a terminology introduced by &ldquo;Zettlekasten.&rdquo; The third type is there to help maximize speed of note retrieval. This derived from a premise that people think in form of &ldquo;questions&rdquo;, but people communicate to ourselves or to other in form of concepts which are represented by either words or pictures. I argue that &ldquo;a concept is a collection of questions&rdquo; <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. More abstractly, I argue that thought is a &ldquo;field space,&rdquo; a question is a &ldquo;vector,&rdquo; and a concept is a &ldquo;point&rdquo; pointed to by a vector.</p>
<p>Lastly, I want to mention about &ldquo;second brain&rdquo; approach. At this point, second brain is a field with theories. It explains what it is, but doesn&rsquo;t say anything about frameworks to build second brain. I write note taking framework in my blog titled &ldquo;Note Taking Pipeline Framework.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.
Peace.</p>

      <description>Personally, I think snippets is under untilize. Same as notes. The fact is people just don&amp;rsquo;t do neither snippets or notes.
I defined code snippet as followed
 A collection of either small/large code which may store in single/multiple files that you will revisit against in the future.
 Focusing on manging code snippets in emacs, few packages come to mind including: yassnipet, auto-yasnippet, yankpad, and code library.
In my workflow, to share code snippet with others, gists is needed.</description>

      <description>Personally, I think snippets is under untilize. Same as notes. The fact is people just don&amp;rsquo;t do neither snippets or notes.
I defined code snippet as followed
 A collection of either small/large code which may store in single/multiple files that you will revisit against in the future.
 Focusing on manging code snippets in emacs, few packages come to mind including: yassnipet, auto-yasnippet, yankpad, and code library.
In my workflow, to share code snippet with others, gists is needed.</description>

      <title>Emacs&#39;s Snippet Management Packages Still Use Text-Based Management? Just Use Sqlite!</title>

      <description>By now, in &amp;lt;2022-12-08 Thu&amp;gt;, it should be conclusive that any type of contents are best organized/managed using database. Responsibilities of database includes retrieve/store data. That&amp;rsquo;s it.
However, emacs manages data as text. Advantages of this is simplicity, but, this argument doesn&amp;rsquo;t even work anymore. why? Emacs supports SQLite as built-in!
I like Emacs because of level of compatibility that it provides, but it frustrates me to realized that open source community is not as collaborative, as a result, Emacs slow to adopts.</description>

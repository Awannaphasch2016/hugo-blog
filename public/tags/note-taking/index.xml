      <description>Note taking is a skill that everyone seems to think that they have &amp;ldquo;solved&amp;rdquo; it. Whatever that means. They are not interested in investing their time to improve their note taking skill.
No interest. No skill. No framework.
Regardless of my critique, I think they draw conclusion fairly. Why? around 6 out of 10 people are knowledge workerÂ 1. A subset of those need to use note at all. A subset of those who use notes need to create reusable notes.</description>

      <description>I propose &amp;ldquo;Note Taking Pipeline Framework&amp;rdquo; as my take on how I implement my &amp;ldquo;second brain.&amp;rdquo; I would argue with a high degree of certainty that this framework is the best in the world without degree of exaggeration.
I think of note taking as a type of data storage with a property that satisfy my note taking philosophy. I wrote about philosophy of note taking in my blog titled &amp;ldquo;Philosophy and Meta Physics of &amp;lsquo;Notes Taking&amp;rsquo;&amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>Doom discord announces important update and fixes. This is where you should take a look first before attempting to pull remote commits that are ahead of your local commits.
Doom emacs has only 1 branch. It used to have 2 main branch master and develop branch, but Henrik give up on develop branch because, I assume, its too much work to make develop branch stable before merging to master. For this reason, instead of merging develop branch to master branch.</description>

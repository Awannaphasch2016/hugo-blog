This essay is my interpretation of a discussion on &ldquo;NFTing the World for the General Good&rdquo; episode on Real Vision TV. The information in the essay are adapted to fit rational narrative that I have in my brain.
This is the beginning of the essay.
The four phases are categorized into the following
 transaction an physical assets transaction of electron transaction of information transaction of digital assets  Each phase increase efficiency of transactions which depends on three factors: object, process, and rules.

Incentive is an abstract concept. Physically, incentives are driven by money, refer to my blog titled &ldquo;Incentives of Owning Money&rdquo; for more detail.

No interest. No skill. No framework.
Regardless of my critique, I think they draw conclusion fairly. Why? around 6 out of 10 people are knowledge worker 1. A subset of those need to use note at all. A subset of those who use notes need to create reusable notes.

A recipe describes which local repository to link the files from and how to clone that repository, if repo is not found locally. With this definition of recipe, one can think of recipe as a build step (recipe) of a package.
Ultimately, a package is defined is a collection of files required for package&rsquo;s build. striaght.el views a package in this manner.

Emacs package manager are split into 2 categories: package.el wrapper or not package.el wrapper.
One idea that straight.el emphasizes a lot is that straight.el manages commits rather than managing a whole a package. Some PM only accept latest commit. Other only accepts repo on github etc. I call this design decision a &ldquo;smallest unit of design implementation.&rdquo;
Other unique takes on managing Emacs packages are Borg (assimilates packages as Git submodules into .

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file.

 Doom Emacs keybinding system is a wrapper over evil mode such that it is smoothly compatible with Emacs.
 If you use Evil mode without Emacs configuration framework such as Spacemacs or Doom Emacs, it is frustrating to know if your keybinding is setup properly and whether it will always work as expected in any circumstances. A common point of failure is when your keybinding is overwritten by some packages.

      The normal workflow of lookup documentation would be to search google, stack-overflow, etc. Alternatively, if you are using IDE, IDE will lookup documentation for you, for example goto-definition etc. Very convenience. What else do you need?
Although, searching online directly is not the best approach, it is everyone last line of defense. On the other hands, IDE is as good as it gets. However, the problem with IDE is that it is context specific.

In the other word, an object should be built to be resurgence, to protect itself from dynamic environment.

 Residue class of modulo N is all \(a\) that satisfy \(a + kN\) where N is a constant and \(k \in \mathbb{Z}\).  Montgomery multiplication is a method for performing fast modular multiplication.
The algorithm uses the Montgomery forms of \(a\) and \(b\) to efficiently compute the Montgomery form of \(ab \mod N\).

      Modern OOP is misused and misunderstood. Modern OOP create an object to abstract over the object internal state. Originally, OOP is intended to be used to abstract objects over the most important processes that take place within environment in which objects exit. This is done by exposing interfaces that are capable of interacting with the outside world 1. In the other word, an object should be built to be resurgence, to protect itself from dynamic environment.

      Doom Emacs has its own keybinding system. A more accurate explaination is
 Doom Emacs keybinding system is a wrapper over evil mode such that it is smoothly compatible with Emacs.
 If you use Evil mode without Emacs configuration framework such as Spacemacs or Doom Emacs, it is frustrating to know if your keybinding is setup properly and whether it will always work as expected in any circumstances. A common point of failure is when your keybinding is overwritten by some packages.

      Hello, guys
This essay is my interpretation of a discussion on &ldquo;NFTing the World for the General Good&rdquo; episode on Real Vision TV. The information in the essay are adapted to fit rational narrative that I have in my brain.
This is the beginning of the essay.
The four phases are categorized into the following
 transaction an physical assets transaction of electron transaction of information transaction of digital assets  Each phase increase efficiency of transactions which depends on three factors: object, process, and rules.

Motivation drive efforts. Effort is a seed of creation and innovation. It just happens that money provides universal motivation due to its utility which is measured by speed of conversion from itself to other assets. Money has fastest conversion rates.

      Edit History  last edit on [2022-07-30 Sat] I can refine this blog more by consolidating the current content to my notes on roam research. I don&rsquo;t have time to do this at the time of writing.      In theory, there is no need for &ldquo;medium&rdquo; of exchange. Any exchange can be anything as long as seller and buyer agree upon. Therefore, one can argue that there will always exist a sequence of exchanges of agreements that satisfy any pair of sellers and buyers.

Transition has been smooth so far, but because I never has experience with Vanilla Emacs before when I encounter a bug in Doom Emacs. I always have to first figure out if it is Doom Emacs problem or Emacs problems. Because of this, I put out a new blog series to help me build a stronger foundation of Vanilla Emacs.

      The normal workflow of lookup documentation would be to search google, stack-overflow, etc. Alternatively, if you are using IDE, IDE will lookup documentation for you, for example goto-definition etc. Very convenience. What else do you need?
Although, searching online directly is not the best approach, it is everyone last line of defense. On the other hands, IDE is as good as it gets. However, the problem with IDE is that it is context specific.

Pull Requests To do a pull-requests, you need to do the following
 fork original repo. create new local branch and checkout to the new branch. commit new changes. send pull requests from new local branch from forked repo (origin) to original repo (upstream).  Alternative to the pull-request workflow I mention above, it is possible to do pull-requests by using git forge 1, adding commit to new branch 2, and then do a pull requests to the target branch in remote.

Org mode subtree is just one of the bullet point (aka. header) within org mode. As the title suggested, this article publication workflow allows one to publish subsection of a content within one of org mode header as a full page article. Main advantage of this method is that user doesn&rsquo;t need to move content from the original location.

      You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.
Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:
`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`
Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file.

 If you use Evil mode without Emacs configuration framework such as Spacemacs or Doom Emacs, it is frustrating to know if your keybinding is setup properly and whether it will always work as expected in any circumstances.

A recipe describes which local repository to link the files from and how to clone that repository, if repo is not found locally. With this definition of recipe, one can think of recipe as a build step (recipe) of a package.
Ultimately, a package is defined is a collection of files required for package&rsquo;s build. striaght.el views a package in this manner.

      This article is an opinion piece on Comparison to other package managers.
Emacs package manager are split into 2 categories: package.el wrapper or not package.el wrapper.
One idea that straight.el emphasizes a lot is that straight.el manages commits rather than managing a whole a package. Some PM only accept latest commit. Other only accepts repo on github etc. I call this design decision a &ldquo;smallest unit of design implementation.&rdquo;
Other unique takes on managing Emacs packages are Borg (assimilates packages as Git submodules into .

No interest. No skill. No framework.

      Edit History  last edit on [2022-07-30 Sat] I can refine this blog more by consolidating the current content to my notes on roam research. I don&rsquo;t have time to do this at the time of writing.      In theory, there is no need for &ldquo;medium&rdquo; of exchange. Any exchange can be anything as long as seller and buyer agree upon. Therefore, one can argue that there will always exist a sequence of exchanges of agreements that satisfy any pair of sellers and buyers.

      This article is based on staright.el README which at the moment doesn&rsquo;t have written document on how transaction works. So This is a work in progress until I either read straight.el codebase or summarize its documentation.
Conceptually, stright.el clones Git repo and them symlinking files into Emacs&rsquo;s load path. A packages in straight.el is defined as recipe as a files which was symlinked together. I have an article on recipe.

      This article is an opinion piece on Comparison to other package managers.
Emacs package manager are split into 2 categories: package.el wrapper or not package.el wrapper.
One idea that straight.el emphasizes a lot is that straight.el manages commits rather than managing a whole a package. Some PM only accept latest commit. Other only accepts repo on github etc. I call this design decision a &ldquo;smallest unit of design implementation.&rdquo;
Other unique takes on managing Emacs packages are Borg (assimilates packages as Git submodules into .

      &ldquo;Internetworking Architecture&rdquo; (Leiner et al. 2009) was a fundamental design that enable machines and computers to communicate via internet regardless of underlying communication protocol.
TCP/IP were implemented in UNIX operating system triggers a widespread adoption of internet (Leiner et al. 2009). Dispersion of protocols began in research community. Recall that predecessor of internet project (it was named &ldquo;internetworking&rdquo; at the time) was funded with the goal to increase speed and efficiency of research collaborations.

      Edit History  last edit on [2022-07-30 Sat] I can refine this blog more by consolidating the current content to my notes on roam research. I don&rsquo;t have time to do this at the time of writing.      In theory, there is no need for &ldquo;medium&rdquo; of exchange. Any exchange can be anything as long as seller and buyer agree upon. Therefore, one can argue that there will always exist a sequence of exchanges of agreements that satisfy any pair of sellers and buyers.

      Note that information I describe here can be found at FAQ page of TRAMP user manual, see here.
From an hour of digging, I discovered that tramp is really specific in term of how it read terminal prompt (aka PS1 environment variable.). It also limited in types of terminal, specified by TERM environment variables. TERM must match tramp terminal default setting (tramp-terminal-type).
I am using zsh shell in my remote compute.

      This stack exchange post state the following.
Debian and RPM packages don&#39;t contain source code, only the compiled result. However, you can fetch the source packages - SRPMS, or the Debian description, patch, and original tarball. That&rsquo;s it. You can only download file that are provided in url where target deb file is located. Which files will be provided? Only package maintainers can determine that. Therefore, there could be a scenario where no source codes are available for download.

On [2022-06-26 Sun], I stumbled upon wiki.c2.com. I was reading about it for a couple hours, and wiki.c2.com seems to share lots of philosophy that The Forest holds. Two hours in, however, I can&rsquo;t seem to get a grip of some very basic stuff like how to read it?

      Alan Kay famously critique World Wide Web (WWW) where HTML is originated. He publicly dislike HTML as followed
 Things like [HTML] happens when we let physicists play with computer.
 He stated that HTML is a bad markup language because people who build HTML thinks their way of representing web page is the only way. He mentioned a (older and) better alternative to HTML is to define protocol based on ordered region on a tape &mdash; back when tapes were still popular means of storage in 1950&rsquo;s.

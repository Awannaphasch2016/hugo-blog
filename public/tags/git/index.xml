      <description>I intend to make this blog be a work-in-progress where I will keep adding useful git workflow when working with a team.
Pull Requests To do a pull-requests, you need to do the following
 fork original repo. create new local branch and checkout to the new branch. commit new changes. send pull requests from new local branch from forked repo (origin) to original repo (upstream).  Alternative to the pull-request workflow I mention above, it is possible to do pull-requests by using git forge 1, adding commit to new branch 2, and then do a pull requests to the target branch in remote.</description>

      <description>One of principle I follow is
 never rely on others&amp;rsquo; people goodwill. and always expect other to be evil when it is possible.
 In quote , type of evil falls into incompetent evil and irresponsible evil. Putting this principle into practice, one must understand structures that govern behavior of people given a particular pursuit of goal.
In this scenario, I refers structure as git log and a particular pursuite of goal as learning and understanding a piece of code such as open source code.</description>

      <description>Note taking is a skill that everyone seems to think that they have &amp;ldquo;solved&amp;rdquo; it. Whatever that means. They are not interested in investing their time to improve their note taking skill.
No interest. No skill. No framework.
Regardless of my critique, I think they draw conclusion fairly. Why? around 6 out of 10 people are knowledge workerÂ 1. A subset of those need to use note at all. A subset of those who use notes need to create reusable notes.</description>

      <description>According to dictionary, freedom is defined as
 The power or right to act, speak, or think as one wants without hindrance or restraint.
 Power is defined as
 The capacity or ability to direct or influence the behavior of others or the course of events.
 That&amp;rsquo;s is power is defined by abilities to restrict others&amp;rsquo; freedom. Therefore, by definitions, an individual with more power has more freedom than others.</description>

      <description>Edit History  last edit on [2022-07-30 Sat]    Money is the most flexible medium of exchange. For more detail please refer to my blog named &amp;ldquo;Money Is A Type of Token.&amp;rdquo;
Motivation drive efforts. Effort is a seed of creation and innovation. It just happens that money provides universal motivation due to its utility which is measured by speed of conversion from itself to other assets. Money has fastest conversion rates.</description>

      <description>Edit History  last edit on [2022-07-30 Sat] I can refine this blog more by consolidating the current content to my notes on roam research. I don&amp;rsquo;t have time to do this at the time of writing.      In theory, there is no need for &amp;ldquo;medium&amp;rdquo; of exchange. Any exchange can be anything as long as seller and buyer agree upon. Therefore, one can argue that there will always exist a sequence of exchanges of agreements that satisfy any pair of sellers and buyers.</description>

      <description>Incentive is an underlying mechanism that drive society at any scale including individual, group of individuals, and human population as a whole.

Another important concept is to accept that money is an indirect form of freedom and power, refer to my blog titled &amp;ldquo;Blog Freedom and Power are two sides of the same coin&amp;rdquo; for more detail.</description>
